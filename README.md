# YOLOv8 Car Counter

YOLOv8 Car Counter is a powerful and optimized solution for counting cars in video streams or images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. This project focuses on enhancing performance by utilizing a tracer instead of capturing cars in every frame and applying masking to focus on the relevant area.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for precise car detection.
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses a tracer to track cars across frames, reducing the computational load.
- **Area Masking**: Focuses on a specific area of interest to improve detection efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended for optimal performance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YOLOv8-Car-Counter.git
   cd YOLOv8-Car-Counter
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the YOLOv8 model weights:**
   - Download the YOLOv8 weights from the official YOLOv8 repository or use your trained model.
   - Place the weights file in the `models` directory.

### Usage

1. **Prepare your input data:**
   - Place your video files or images in the `input` directory.

2. **Run the car counter:**
   ```sh
   python car_counter.py --input_path ./input --output_path ./output
   ```

3. **Check the output:**
   - Processed videos or images with car count annotations will be saved in the `output` directory.

### Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the car counter by modifying the `config.yaml` file. Key parameters include:

- `confidence_threshold`: Confidence threshold for YOLOv8 detections.
- `nms_threshold`: Non-max suppression threshold.
- `mask_area`: Coordinates for the area of interest.

### Example

```sh
python car_counter.py --input_path ./input/sample_video.mp4 --output_path ./output
```
